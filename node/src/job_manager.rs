/// The Job Manager’s job is to take events coming from P2P, tickers, RPC, etc
/// and give the task to the runtime when there is an available thread. Each
/// event comes with a ID that corresponds with that task. It’s important that
/// tasks that cannot be processed at the same time must have the same ID to
/// prevent this. For example with aggregating. (If you open two threads that
/// both do `counter += 1` the result would be `counter = 1` instead of `counter
/// = 2` and information will get lost)
///
/// The Job Manager is essentially pretty dumb, it takes the event and checks if
/// there is no thread currently running with that ID. If not and there is a
/// thread available, it spins up a new thread and gives the event information
/// along with some arguments.
